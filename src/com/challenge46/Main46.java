/**
 It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

 9 = 7 + 2×12
 15 = 7 + 2×22
 21 = 3 + 2×32
 25 = 7 + 2×32
 27 = 19 + 2×22
 33 = 31 + 2×12

 It turns out that the conjecture was false.

 What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
