 * A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.
 * Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

 Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?
